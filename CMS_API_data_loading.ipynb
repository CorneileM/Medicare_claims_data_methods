    "# Loading data from the BCDA API\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to load data from the Blue Button 2.0 Beneficiary Claims Data API (BCDA) and uploading the JSON data to an AWS storage bucket. The data loaded and transformed into patient-level longitudinal data for analysis (see *notebookX*).\n",
    "\n",
    "*The notebook will largely follow instructions available in this link: https://bcda.cms.gov/guide.html#try-the-api*\n",

    "## Step 1: Obtain an access token\n",
    "First we need to decide what size and type of synthetic dataset we want to download. We can choose from the following main type options (as outlined on the BCDA website):\n",
    "\n",
    "**Simple Datasets - Five Sizes**\n",
    "Five of these datasets are simple approximations of BCDA data designed for model entities to test the stress of retrieving and downloading large data files into their internal ingestion processes. These datasets are offered in various sizes so that organizations can test files with a number of beneficiaries that best matches the needs of their organization (the datasets range from 50 to 30,000 synthetic beneficiaries). However, the data in these API payloads will not reflect the distribution of disease and demographic information you might expect from production data.\n",
    "- Sizes: 50, 500, 5,000, 15,000, 30,000 beneficiaries\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advanced Datasets - Two Sizes**\n",
    "These two datasets are designed to offer data that is a more accurate representation of BCDA production data. They follow BCDAâ€™s Bulk FHIR format and should contain a more realistic distribution of disease and demographic information. The advanced datasets are offered in two sizes: Extra Small (100 beneficiaries) and Large (10,000 beneficiaries). We suggest using the Extra-Small Model Entity file to simply view and begin to understand the format of BCDA data. You may want to use the Large dataset for more in-depth exploration of the data or early load testing of your systems.\n",
    "- Sizes: 100, 10,000 beneficiaries\n",
    "\n",
    "*There are also partially adjudicated datasets -- but we won't be using these for now.*\n",
    "\n",
    "As an initial step, we will download the Extra Small Advanced Dataset (100 beneficiaries) to understand the data format and structure. We will then proceed to download the Large Advanced Dataset (10,000 beneficiaries) for further analysis and practice."
